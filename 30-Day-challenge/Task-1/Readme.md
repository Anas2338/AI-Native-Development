# AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 1

## Understanding the AI-Native Turning Point

### What Does AI-Driven Development Mean to You?
AI-driven development means using artificial intelligence to help create software more efficiently. I see it as having a smart assistant that can suggest code, explain errors, and accelerate the development process. It doesn’t replace the developer, but it enhances productivity by handling repetitive tasks and offering useful guidance.

### How Do You See the Future of Human–AI Collaboration in Software Development?
I see the future of Human–AI collaboration becoming a true partnership. AI will manage repetitive work, suggest solutions, and support faster learning, while humans will focus on creativity, critical thinking, and decision-making. Rather than replacing developers, AI will serve as a powerful tool that boosts productivity and enables better software to be built with less effort.
